# MultiLinear-Regression-House-case-study

This code contains MultiLinear Regression Manual approach where we applied two ways
1. add variable one by one and check R squared value
2. or add all variables at a time and then keep dropping the value by checking vif and p value here we consider  p >= 0.05 as high and vif >= 5 as high
